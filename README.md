## lunavg: NanoVG and NanoSVG bindings for Lua

lunavg is a Lua OpenGL vector graphics rendering library for OpenGL, based on Mikko Mononen's 
[nanovg library](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg).

lunavg is also highly inspired by the work of Stefano Trettel's high quality
[moonlibs libraries](https://github.com/stetre/moonlibs).

It runs on GNU/Linux and on Windows (MSYS2/MinGW/OSX) and requires
[Lua](http://www.lua.org/) (>=5.3).

This project is WIP, I am learning C, lua, nanovg and LuaAutoC along while creating these bindings.
So far, this project is just a rip-off of moonlibs, nanovg and nanosvg, all the credits go to their respective authors.
